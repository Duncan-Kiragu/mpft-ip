##Ping Pong application
### Introduction
This application takes the users number input and displays it in a range from 1 to the number
It then looks if the number in a range is divisible by 3,5 15 and replaces those numbers with ping pong and Ping pong respectively
###How it works
- user inputs a number from 1-100
- the program checks if it is a valid number and is in the range
- a loop is created to keep on adding one from 1 till it reaches the inputed number
- A series of if else statements check divisibility of numbers by 3,5,15 and replaces them with a new value
- the range is placed in list items to be displayed on the html file
